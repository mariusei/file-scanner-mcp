FILE: history.py

PROBLEM:
  "When did this function change, and how?" is answered today with
  `git log -L` (a line range that drifts) or `git log -S` (a string that
  matches prose). The field study's agents asked for it and rebuilt it by
  hand: log the file, show it at each commit, compare by eye. Brief §5.4
  and §10: structure-aware history, one structure followed through
  renames, moves and rewrites.

SOLUTION:
  The commits that touched the file (`git log --follow`, so a moved file
  is followed under its earlier path), the file scanned at each commit
  (the parse cache makes a second look free), and the structural diff's
  own rows between neighbouring commits, filtered to the one structure:
  a signature or body change is a `~` event with the diff's note, a
  rename pairs by identical body and becomes `=` with the earlier name
  taken up for the older commits, the commit that introduced it is `+`.
  Commits that touched the file but not the structure are counted, not
  listed.

SCOPE:
  ✓ path::name or path:line at a ref, followed backwards through renames
    of the structure and moves of the file
  ✗ no similarity beyond an identical body (a rewrite reads as - then +),
    no history across files other than a whole-file move
