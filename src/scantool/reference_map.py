"""
Directed reference mapping — finds producers (route handlers, templates) that are
referenced NOWHERE, i.e. candidate dead/orphaned.

The call graph cannot see these: a route handler is invoked by the framework via
its decorator, a template by a render call — never by a named in-repo call. So a
separate, convention-aware layer resolves the reference: a SPEC declares how to
find producers, how to find references (consumers), and what a distinctive
matchable token is; the engine does producers -> consumers -> resolve -> orphan.

Precision-first by design (orphan/negative claims are coverage-bounded, so do not
cry wolf):
  - the spec marks EXTERNAL entries (root, health, callbacks) — never orphan
  - a producer with no DISTINCTIVE static token is UNRESOLVABLE, not orphan
  - reached if any distinctive token appears in the consumer blob, or the handler
    is referenced by name — lenient on "reached" so the orphan set stays
    high-confidence (misses some real orphans rather than inventing them)

Cross-language by nature (string matching). Sits alongside the AST/call graph.
