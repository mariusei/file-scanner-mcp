FILE: launcher.py

PROBLEM:
  Registering scantool as an MCP server is the user's only install step, but
  the agent behind that client reads code through its shell. `sct` has to
  exist in that shell without a second step, on every platform, for every
  client — and the client may start the server from an ephemeral `uvx`
  environment whose console scripts are on no PATH.

SOLUTION:
  Two channels, both computed from the interpreter the server runs under:
  1. At server start, a launcher in uv's tool bin directory that runs
     `<this interpreter> -m scantool.cli`. A POSIX sh file (also for Git
     Bash/MSYS on Windows) and, on Windows, a .cmd file for cmd.exe and
     PowerShell. A marker comment makes it idempotent; a foreign `sct` is
     never touched.
  2. Every tool description carries the absolute fallback command line, for
     shells where the bin directory is not on PATH.

SCOPE:
  ✓ launcher files, marker, SCANTOOL_NO_CLI opt-out, never fails the server
  ✓ interpreter path in forward-slash, quoted form for descriptions
  ✗ never edits PATH or shell profiles; no symlinks (Windows needs privileges)
